Codex is an innovative mobile game that transforms everyday shopping into an adventurous collectible card game. By simply scanning barcodes on products around you, you unlock unique trading cards, each with its own score ranging from 1-100 and assigned rarity. The thrill of hunting for legendary cards turns mundane tasks into exciting quests, making Codex an engaging experience for users of all ages.

## How It Works

At the heart of Codex lies a smart and seamless mechanism. Each product's barcode contains a unique series of digits. When a user scans a barcode using their mobile device, these digits serve as a seed for a random card generator. This ingenious approach ensures that:

- **Consistency Across Devices:** Two different devices scanning the same barcode, even in offline mode, will generate the exact same trading card.

- **Unlimited Discoveries:** With millions of products available worldwide, the possibilities for discovering new cards are virtually endless.

Codex merges the physical world with digital collectibles in a way that's accessible, fun, and endlessly captivating. Whether you're in a grocery store, at home, or exploring new places, Codex turns every barcode into a potential treasure trove of collectible cards.
